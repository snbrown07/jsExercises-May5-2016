  EXAMPLE ANSWER
  Create a function named 'example' with no parameters
  Inside the body, create a for loop that repeats 3 times
  Inside the for loop, call run()
*/
function example() {
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    run();
  }
}

/*
  Create a function named 'looper' with no parameters
  Inside the body, create a for loop that repeats 5 times
  Inside the for loop, call run()
*/


/*
  Create a function named 'inception' with one parameter
  Name the parameter anything you want
  Inside the body, create a for loop that repeats based on the value of the parameter
  Inside the for loop, call run()
  ie:
    inception(2) -> run() is called twice
    inception(3) -> run() is called thrice
    inception(4) -> run() is called four times
    inception(0) -> run() should not be called
*/


/*
  Create a function named 'redLightGreenLight' with two parameters
  Name the parameters anything you want
  Inside the body, create a for loop that repeats based on the value of the first parameter
  If the second parameter is true, run() is called, else stop() is called
  ie:
    redLightGreenLight(2, true) -> run() is called twice
    redLightGreenLight(3, false) -> stop() is called thrice
    redLightGreenLight(4, true) -> run() is called four times
    redLightGreenLight(0, false) -> stop() should not be called
*/


/*
  Create a function named 'range' with two parameters
  Name the parameters anything you want
  Inside the body, create a for loop that repeats based on the two parameters
  The first parameter will indicate the STARTING point
  The second parameter will indicate the ENDING points
  Inside the for loop, call run()
  ie:
    range(0, 2) -> run() is called twice
    range(1, 2) -> run() is called once
    range(3, 6) -> run() is called thrice
    range(2, 0) -> run() should not be called
*/


/*
  Create a function named 'rangeAdv' with three parameters
  Name the parameters anything you want
  Inside the body, create a for loop that repeats based on the three parameters
  The first parameter will indicate the STARTING point
  The second parameter will indicate the ENDING points
  The third parameter will decide how much the loop will increment
    (hint: you will need to change the i++ part)
  Inside the for loop, call run()
  ie:
    rangeAdv(0, 2, 1) -> run() is called twice
    rangeAdv(0, 4, 2) -> run() is called twice
    rangeAdv(1, 5, 3) -> run() is called once
    rangeAdv(2, 0, 5) -> run() should not be called
    rangeAdv(0, 2, 5) -> run() is called once
